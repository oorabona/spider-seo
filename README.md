# Spider-SEO

This package aims at providing a different approach for Meteor projects to allow
easy indexing for bots and most notably search engines.

Rendering is done client side thanks to Meteor. Instead of having to use PhantomJS
or other software to 'simulate' the behavior of a client, clients update themselves
a database containing rendered HTML code.
